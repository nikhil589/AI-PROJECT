# ESTIMATION OF TRAFFIC CONGESTION

In this project, the estimation of traffic congestion is done using hidden markov model. The data is collected for a considered segment of the road from the google maps. Forward algorithm is used to predict the traffic congestion for the next interval using these sequence of observations.
